Captcha as a gRaphical Password - CaRP

This is a final year project for BE Computer Engineering.

We propose a new method for user authentication based on graphical passwords.

Motivation:
Proposing a strong and intuitive authentication scheme.
Key takeaways: I. Secure from - 1. Bruteforce 2. Shoulder Surfing
	      II. Dynamic passwords

We used the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for creating the graphical image from which the user gets the password.

Technologies Used:
1. Python - Flask
2. Python - numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, matplotlib
3. Javascript
